## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
sessions_models
```

Also render a table without showing the code:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sessions_models %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
demand %>%
  df_to_ts() %>%
  dygraph() %>%
  dyOptions(fillGraph = T, useDataTimezone = T)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
